<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi there! My name is Pierre, and I am excited to introduce myself to you. I am 23 years old and currently studying  Computer Science in Houston TX USA.

  In my free time, I love to read some books and watch some classic movies, which helps me unwind and stay creative. I am also passionate about meeting new people with different cultures, ethnics, countries and learn new things from them.  I enjoy finding ways to get involved and make a positive impact in my community.
  
  Reflecting on this semester, I have learned so much about being patient and discipline throughout this semester. I am grateful for the opportunities I have had to grow and learn, and I am excited to take these experiences with me into the future.
  
  Looking ahead, my goal is to work or  run one of the biggest multinational technology company like Google. Whether it's pursuing a new career path, traveling to new places, or learning a new skill, I am excited to see where life takes me.
  
  Thank you for taking the time to get to know me a little better. I hope you enjoy exploring my project and learning more about my interests, experiences, and perspectives.</p>
